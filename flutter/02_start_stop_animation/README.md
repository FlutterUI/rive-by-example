# Start and Stop Looping Animation

This example plays a continously looping animation, and has a button that lets you start and stop the animation.

We can continue to use ```SimpleAnimation``` in this case. It exposes the ```isActive``` flag, which you can set to true or false to control whether the animation is playing.
