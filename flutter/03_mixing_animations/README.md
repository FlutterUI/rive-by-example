# Mixing Animations

This example mixes multiple animations together while playing back an artboard. It really is just a case of creating multiple animation controllers and adding them to the artboard.

We can still use ```SimpleAnimation``` here, and use the ```isActive``` flag to start and stop animations we're mixing together.
